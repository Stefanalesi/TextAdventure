Escape the Bunker

by Stefan Alesi, Richter Tobias, Andreas Hasenschwandtner

Escape the Bunker is a text-based adventure game where you must navigate through a 
post-apocalyptic bunker to find a way to contact the outside world and escape. 
The world above has been devastated by a nuclear disaster, and your only hope 
of survival is to use the items and resources you find within the bunker. 
However, time is running out as your food supply is limited.

Game Mechanics:
- Navigate through various rooms in the bunker using standard directional commands (n, s, e, w).
- Collect and use items to solve puzzles and unlock new areas.
- Monitor your food supply as it decreases over time, adding urgency to your quest.
- Craft useful tools at the workbench to aid in your escape.

Starting in your home, you must quickly decide which items to bring into the bunker. 
Once inside, explore rooms such as the living room, storage, and bedroom. 
Each room contains different items and potential solutions to the obstacles you face. 
Use items like a screwdriver, paperclip, or multitool to unlock doors and compartments, 
ultimately leading you to the tools needed to contact the military and secure your rescue.

Will you manage to survive and escape the bunker, or will time run out? 
Test your wits and resourcefulness in this gripping adventure!
